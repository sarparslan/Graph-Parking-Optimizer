# Graph-Parking-Optimizer

This Java program is designed for an Airport parking facility, which is represented as a graph with N nodes and M edges. The program calculates the minimum total cost for K identical vehicles entering the parking facility, considering the capacity of parking slots, edge weights, and parking fees.


At the Airport, there is a parking facility represented as a graph with N nodes, each node representing a parking slot. Each parking slot has a capacity for holding vehicles. Vehicles enter the parking facility in natural order, and for each vehicle, the program calculates the minimum total cost incurred by the vehicle owner. The total cost includes the cost of the path taken to reach the parking slot and the parking fee for the slot.

## Features

- Calculation of the minimum total cost for vehicles entering the parking facility.
- Consideration of parking slot capacity, edge weights, and parking fees.
- Support for multiple test cases and customizable parking facility parameters.
- Clear and extensible Java codebase.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile and run the Java program using your preferred Java development environment.

3. Follow the prompts to input the necessary parameters and calculate the minimum total cost for vehicles.

## Usage

To use the the Airport Parking Cost Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Run the Java program.

2. Enter the number of nodes (parking slots), number of edges (connections), and parking fee (F).

3. Provide the seating capacity for each parking slot and specify the distance (weight) between parking slots.

4. Enter the number of vehicles (K) entering the parking facility.

5. The program will calculate and display the minimum total cost for each vehicle entering the facility.

## Input Format

The input format includes the following:

- The number of nodes (N), number of edges (M), and parking fee (F).
- The seating capacity of each parking slot.
- For each edge, the source node (u), destination node (v), and edge weight (w).
- The number of vehicles (K) entering the parking facility.

## Output Format

The program calculates and displays the minimum total cost for each vehicle entering the  Airport parking facility. It also provides additional information about the analysis.
